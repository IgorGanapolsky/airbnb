## 3. Multi-Agent Development Workflow

This section introduces a revolutionary multi-agent development workflow that combines the power of AI with advanced Git techniques to dramatically boost productivity. This workflow is especially beneficial for a solo founder who needs to manage multiple tasks concurrently.

### 3.1. The Core Concept: Git Worktrees and AI Agents

The foundation of this workflow is the combination of `git worktree` and multiple instances of an AI coding assistant like Claude Code. This allows you to work on several features or bug fixes simultaneously, each in its own isolated environment with a dedicated AI agent.

**3.1.1. Git Worktrees**

A `git worktree` allows you to have multiple working trees attached to the same repository. This means you can have different branches checked out in different directories, all sharing the same `.git` database. This is a game-changer for parallel development, as it eliminates the need to constantly stash changes and switch branches.

**3.1.2. Claude Multi-Agent Workflow**

By running a separate Claude Code session in each worktree, you create a team of AI agents, each with its own context and focus. You can delegate tasks to these agents and switch between them seamlessly, effectively parallelizing your development efforts.

### 3.2. Setting Up the Workflow

Here’s how to set up this powerful workflow:

**3.2.1. Create Worktrees for Your Tasks**

For each task (e.g., a new feature, a bug fix), create a new worktree. It’s a good practice to name the worktree directory after the task or issue number.

```bash
# From your main project directory (e.g., SuperPassword)
git worktree add ../superpassword-feature-onboarding feature/onboarding
git worktree add ../superpassword-bugfix-login bugfix/login-crash
```

**3.2.2. Use a Terminal Multiplexer**

Use a terminal multiplexer like iTerm2 (on macOS) or tmux (on Linux/Windows) to create multiple terminal panes or windows. Each pane will be dedicated to a specific worktree and Claude session.

**3.2.3. Start Claude Sessions**

In each terminal pane, navigate to a different worktree and start a Claude Code session:

```bash
# Pane 1: Onboarding Feature
cd ../superpassword-feature-onboarding
claude

# Pane 2: Login Bugfix
cd ../superpassword-bugfix-login
claude
```

### 3.3. Integrating with GitHub Issues and Projects

This workflow integrates seamlessly with GitHub Issues and Projects, providing a powerful system for task management.

**3.3.1. GitHub Projects (Kanban)**

Use a GitHub Project board to visualize your work. Create columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Each task will be represented by a card on the board.

**3.3.2. GitHub Issues**

Each card on your Kanban board should correspond to a GitHub Issue. This is where you will document the requirements, acceptance criteria, and any relevant details for the task.

**3.3.3. The Workflow in Action**

1.  **Create an Issue**: When you have a new task, create a new GitHub Issue for it.
2.  **Move to "In Progress"**: When you are ready to start working on the issue, move the corresponding card to the "In Progress" column on your Kanban board.
3.  **Create a Worktree**: Create a new git worktree for the issue.
4.  **Start a Claude Session**: Start a new Claude Code session in the worktree and provide it with the context of the GitHub Issue.
5.  **Develop with AI**: Work with your AI agent to complete the task.
6.  **Create a Pull Request**: Once the task is complete, create a pull request from the worktree branch.
7.  **Move to "Done"**: After the pull request is merged, move the card to the "Done" column.

### 3.4. Cursor CLI Integration

Cursor is an AI-first code editor. The Cursor CLI can be integrated into this workflow to further enhance your AI-assisted development capabilities. You can use the Cursor CLI to quickly open files, search for code, and perform other actions within your worktrees, all from the command line.

### 3.5. Benefits for the Solo Founder

*   **Massive Productivity Boost**: Work on multiple tasks in parallel without the mental overhead of context switching.
*   **Efficient Task Management**: A clear and organized workflow for managing your development tasks.
*   **Cost-Effective**: This entire workflow can be implemented with free and open-source tools.
*   **Modern and Scalable**: A cutting-edge workflow that will serve you well as your project grows.
